# Billing Portal UX Improvement - Implementation Report

## Summary
Enhanced the Stripe Customer Portal flow with improved error handling, automatic customer reconciliation, comprehensive telemetry, and a dedicated error UI component.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. New Error UI Component (`PortalErrorCard.tsx`)
**Purpose**: Replace generic toast notifications with a prominent, actionable error card.

**Features**:
- **Context-aware messaging**: Different titles and descriptions based on error type
  - `no_customer`: "Billing Account Setup" 
  - `portal_not_configured`: "Portal Configuration Needed"
  - Other errors: "Billing Portal Unavailable"
- **Three action buttons**:
  - **Retry** (primary CTA): Re-attempts portal creation
  - **Open in New Tab**: Uses cached portal URL when popup is blocked
  - **Contact Support**: Opens email to support
- **Dev diagnostics section**: Shows error codes, request IDs, and Stripe errors (dev mode only)
- **Visual distinction**: Red border and background to highlight the error state

### 2. Backend Improvements (`customer-portal/index.ts`)

#### A. Request Tracking
- Each request gets a unique `requestId` via `crypto.randomUUID()`
- All responses include the `requestId` for support triage

#### B. Comprehensive Metrics & Logging
Added structured telemetry:
```
[METRIC] portal_session_attempt - Every attempt to create a portal session
[METRIC] portal_session_success - Successful portal creation
[METRIC] portal_session_failure - Failed attempts with error codes
[METRIC] customer_reconciliation_attempt - When reconciliation is attempted
[METRIC] customer_reconciliation_success - Successful customer creation
[METRIC] customer_reconciliation_failure - Failed reconciliation
```

#### C. Automatic Customer Reconciliation
**Problem**: Users who complete checkout may not have their Stripe customer linked yet (webhook pending).

**Solution**: If no customer is found by email:
1. Attempt to create a new Stripe customer with user's email
2. Store Supabase user ID in metadata: `{ supabase_user_id: user.id }`
3. Return clear message: "We're linking your billing account — try again in a few seconds."
4. Log reconciliation attempts and results

#### D. Enhanced Error Responses
All errors now return structured JSON:
```json
{
  "error": "error_code",
  "message": "User-friendly message",
  "action": "retry|contact_support|open_in_tab",
  "requestId": "uuid",
  "url": "portal_url_if_available"
}
```

### 3. Frontend Improvements (`SubscriptionCard.tsx`)

#### A. Error State Management
- `portalError`: Stores current error details
- `cachedPortalUrl`: Saves portal URL for fallback "Open in New Tab" action
- `loading`: Tracks ongoing operations

#### B. Smart Error Handling
- **Popup blocked**: Detects when browser blocks new window and shows fallback UI
- **Customer reconciliation**: Shows appropriate message when linking account
- **Portal not configured**: Directs user to contact support
- **Network errors**: Provides retry option

#### C. Progressive Enhancement
1. First attempt: Try to open portal in new tab
2. Popup blocked: Show "Open in New Tab" button with cached URL
3. Reconciliation needed: Show "retry in a few seconds" message
4. Critical error: Show "Contact Support" option

#### D. Dev Mode Diagnostics
Error card shows (dev mode only):
- Error code
- Request ID for log correlation
- Full Stripe error message

## Testing Scenarios & Expected Behavior

**Status**: ✅ Implemented

### ✅ Scenario 4: Missing Stripe Customer (No Checkout)
**Setup**: User never completed checkout  
**Expected**: New customer created, then portal opened  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented (automatic reconciliation)

### ⚠️ Scenario 5: Portal Not Configured in Stripe

**Setup**: Wrong API key or account issue  
**Expected**: Generic error message, logs contain details, "Contact Support" shown  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented

## Metrics & Monitoring

### Success Metrics
Monitor in logs with `[METRIC]` prefix:
- `portal_session_attempt` - Total attempts
- `portal_session_success` - Successful opens (target: >95%)
- `portal_session_failure` - Failed attempts (monitor error codes)
- `customer_reconciliation_attempt` - Reconciliation triggers
- `customer_reconciliation_success` - Successful auto-links
- `customer_reconciliation_failure` - Failed reconciliations (needs investigation)

### Error Codes to Monitor
- `popup_blocked` - Browser popup blocker (expected, has fallback)
- `customer_reconciliation_failed` - Auto-linking failed (action required)
- `portal_not_configured` - Stripe portal not set up (action required)
- `account_invalid` - Stripe account issue (critical)
- `unknown` - Unexpected errors (investigation needed)

### Key Performance Indicators
1. **Portal Success Rate**: `portal_session_success / portal_session_attempt` (target: >95%)
2. **Reconciliation Rate**: `customer_reconciliation_success / customer_reconciliation_attempt` (target: >90%)
3. **Popup Block Rate**: Count of `popup_blocked` errors (informational)

## Support Runbook

### Issue: User clicks "Manage Subscription" but nothing happens

**Diagnosis Steps**:
1. Check if error card appeared below subscription card
2. If in dev mode, check error code in diagnostics section
3. Search logs for request ID shown in error card
4. Review `[METRIC]` logs to see failure reason

**Common Causes & Solutions**:

| Error Code | Cause | Solution |
|------------|-------|----------|
| `popup_blocked` | Browser blocked popup | User should click "Open in New Tab" |
| `customer_reconciliation_failed` | Stripe API issue | Check Stripe API status, retry |
| `portal_not_configured` | Portal not activated | Activate in Stripe Dashboard |
| `account_invalid` | Stripe account issue | Check Stripe account status |
| `unknown` | Network or other error | Check network, retry |

### Issue: "Billing portal unavailable" error card shown

**User-Facing Actions**:
1. Ask user to click "Retry" button
2. If retry fails, click "Open in New Tab" (if button available)
3. If still failing, click "Contact Support"

**Support Actions**:
1. Get request ID from user (shown in dev mode or ask them to retry and note time)
2. Search logs: `[CUSTOMER-PORTAL] Function started - {"requestId":"..."}`
3. Follow log trail to identify failure point
4. Check corresponding `[METRIC]` entry for error code
5. Apply solution from table above

### Issue: "We're linking your billing account" message

**Explanation**: User completed checkout recently, webhook may be pending  
**Action**: Wait 5-10 seconds and click "Retry"  
**If persists**: 
1. Check Stripe Dashboard for customer creation
2. Verify webhook delivery
3. Manual reconciliation may be needed

## Required Configuration

### ⚠️ Stripe Customer Portal Setup
Before portal can work in production:

1. **Test Mode** (for development/staging):
   - Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal
   - Configure portal features
   - Activate the portal

2. **Live Mode** (for production):
   - Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/portal
   - Configure portal features
   - Activate the portal

**Common Configuration Issues**:
- Portal not activated → `portal_not_configured` error
- Missing payment method update feature → Users can't update cards
- Missing cancel subscription feature → Users can't cancel

## Rollback Plan

### If Critical Issues Occur

1. **Immediate Response** (< 5 minutes):
   - Monitor `portal_session_failure` spike in logs
   - Check error codes to identify issue type

2. **Temporary Mitigation** (< 15 minutes):
   - Add feature flag: `ENABLE_AUTO_RECONCILIATION=false`
   - Disable automatic customer creation
   - Show "Contact Support" for all missing customer cases

3. **Full Rollback** (if needed):
   ```bash
   # Revert to previous version
   git revert <commit-hash>
   git push
   ```
   - Previous version showed simpler toast errors
   - No automatic reconciliation
   - Users with missing customers need manual support

4. **Communication**:
   - If widespread issue: Show banner on dashboard
   - Email affected users
   - Update status page
